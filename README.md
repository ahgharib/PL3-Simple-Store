PL3 College Project 
Simple Store Simulator (User-Only Interaction):
 Objective: Create a virtual store management system using F#.
Build a simple store simulation where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and 
calculate total costs.
 Features
1. Product Catalog (Displayed to User):
o The store will have a list of available products, each with the following 
details:
▪ Name
▪ Price
▪ Description
o The list of products will be stored in an F# collection (e.g., List or Map) 
which will be initialized by you in the F# code.
2. User Interaction:
o Browse Products: The user will be able to view the products available in 
the store.
o Add to Cart: Users can select items by name and add them to their cart.
o View Cart: The user can view the items in their cart at any time.
o Checkout: Once the user is done shopping, they can view the total price 
of the items in their cart.
3. Cart Management:
o The cart will be represented as a list of product names.
o Users can add and remove products from their cart.
o At checkout, the program will calculate the total cost by summing the 
prices of the items in the cart.
